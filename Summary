Performance-Aware Programming

1. Waste, example python taking 100 instructions to accomplish what can be done with 1.
2. Instructions per clock, allow the cpu to execute more by grouping operations that don't depend on each other.
3. Single Instruction, Multiple Data, operate on more data with each instruction.
4. Caching, be aware of memory layers and their performance.
5. Multithreading, divide the work between multiple threads to take advantage of multiple cores and multiple threads per core.
6. Algoritms and mathematics are extra, be aware of the above when designing algorithms and using mathematics.
